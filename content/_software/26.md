title: "LiT-4-RSVQA: Lightweight Transformer-based Visual Question Answering in Remote Sensing"

description: |
     This repository contains code for pretraining of lightweight tranformer-based image encoders for integration into lightweight tranformer-based visual question answering (VQA) systems and code for training of assembled VQA systems for remote sensing (RS). It also contains an overview of the training results for multiple runs on three different system configurations. The code is written in pytorch using pytorch-lightning.
