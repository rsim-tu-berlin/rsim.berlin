title: "DUCH: Deep Unsupervised Contrastive Hashing"

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our deep unsupervised cross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for RS text-image retrieval. The  DUCH is made up of two main modules: 1) feature extraction module (which extracts deep representations of the text-image modalities); and 2) hashing module (which learns to generate cross-modal binary hash codes from the extracted representations).
