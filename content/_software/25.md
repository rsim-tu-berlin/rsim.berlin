title: "Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-Spectral Compression of Hyperspectral Images"

description: |
     This repository contains code which adapts the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model to perform spatio-spectral compression of hyperspectral images. Two new models are introduced: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks; and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions. The code is written in Tensorflow.
