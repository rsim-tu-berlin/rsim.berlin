title: "Label Noise Robust Image Representation Learning based on Supervised Variational Autoencoders in Remote Sensing"

description: |
     This repository contains the code for our label noise robust image representation learning (IRL) method. Our method aims to prevent the interference of noisy labels on IRL independently from the learning task being considered in remote sensing. To this end, the proposed method combines a supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE) with any kind of DNN by defining variational generative process based on image features. This allows us to define the importance of each training sample for IRL based on the loss values acquired from the SVAE and the task head of the considered DNN. Then, the proposed method imposes lower importance to images with noisy labels, while giving higher importance to those with correct labels during IRL.
