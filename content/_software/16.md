title:  A Novel Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Image Retrieval Method in Remote Sensing

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our self-supervised cross-modal remote sensing image retrieval method. Our method aims to: i) model mutual-information between different modalities in a self-supervised manner; ii) retain the distributions of modal-specific feature spaces similar; and iii) define most similar images within each modality without requiring any annotated training images. To this end, the objective of our method includes three loss functions that simultaneously: i) maximize mutual information of different modalities for inter-modal similarity preservation; ii) minimize the angular distance of multi-modal image tuples for the elimination of inter-modal discrepancies; and iii) increase cosine similarity of most similar images within each modality for the characterization of intra-modal similarities.
