title: A Deep Multi-Attention Driven Approach for Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification

description: |
    This repository includes the code for our multi-attention driven multi-label scene classification approach.
    This approach is based on three main steps. The first step describes the complex spatial and spectral content
    of image local areas by a K-Branch CNN that includes spatial resolution specific CNN branches. The second
    step initially characterizes the importance scores of different local areas of each image and then defines
    a global descriptor for each image based on these scores. This is achieved by a multi-attention strategy
    that utilizes the bidirectional long short-term memory networks. The final step achieves the classification
    of RS image scenes with multi-labels.
