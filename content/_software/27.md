title: "Learning Across Decentralized Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Archives with Federated Learning"

description: |
     This repository contains code for novel multi-modal FL framework that aims to learn from decentralized multi-modal RS image archives for RS image classification problems. The proposed framework is made up of three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3) mutual information maximization (MIM). The code is written in PyTorch.
