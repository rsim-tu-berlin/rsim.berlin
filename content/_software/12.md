title: A Consensual Collaborative Learning Method for Remote Sensing Image Classification Under Noisy Multi-Labels

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our multi-label learning method based on the idea of co-training for scene classification of remote sensing (RS) images with noisy labels. Our proposed Consensual Collaborative Multi-Label Learning (CCML) method identifies, ranks and corrects training images with noisy multi-labels through four main modules: 1) discrepancy module; 2) group lasso module; 3) flipping module; and 4) swap module. The discrepancy module ensures that the two networks learn diverse features, while obtaining the same predictions. The group lasso module detects the potentially noisy labels by estimating the label uncertainty based on the aggregation of two collaborative networks. The flipping module corrects the identified noisy labels, whereas the swap module exchanges the ranking information between the two networks. The code is written in Tensorflow 2.
