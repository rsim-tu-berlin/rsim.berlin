title: "BigEarthNet v2.0 Pretrained Model Weights"

description: |
  We provide weights for several different pretrained models.
  The model weights for the best-performing model,
  based on the macro average precision score on the recommended test split,
  have been uploaded. All models have been trained using:
  i) BigEarthNet-S1 data only (S1),
  ii) BigEarthNet-S2 data only (S2), or
  iii) both BigEarthNet-S1 and -S2 (S1+S2) together.
