title: "Deep Learning Models for BigEarthNet-MM with 19 Classes"

description: |
    This repository contains code to use the multi-modal BigEarthNet (BigEarthNet-MM) archive with
    the nomenclature of 19 classes for deep learning applications. The nomenclature of 19 classes was
    defined by interpreting and arranging the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) Level-3 nomenclature based on
    the properties of Sentinel-2 images. The tools are implemented as Python scripts.
