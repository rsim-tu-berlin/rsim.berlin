title:  Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images for Tree Species Classification Based on Explanation Methods

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our comparative study on explanation methods in the context of weakly supervised semantic segmentation for tree species mapping. In this study, four different deep learning explanation methods have been compared in terms of their: 1) segmentation accuracy; 2) model size; and 3) segmentation speed. The code is written based on PyTorch.
