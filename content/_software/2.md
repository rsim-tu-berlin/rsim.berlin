title: "SD-RSIC: Summarization Driven Deep Remote Sensing Image Captioning"

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our Summarization Driven Remote Sensing Image Captioning (SD-RSIC) approach.
    The SD-RSIC approach consists of three main steps. The first step obtains the standard image captions by jointly
    exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The second step,
    unlike the existing RS image captioning methods, summarizes the ground-truth captions of each training image
    into a single caption by exploiting sequence to sequence neural networks and eliminates the redundancy present
    in the training set. The third step automatically defines the adaptive weights associated to each RS image to
    combine the standard captions with the summarized captions based on the semantic content of the image. This is
    achieved by a novel adaptive weighting strategy defined in the context of LSTM networks. The code is written
    based on TensorFlow.
