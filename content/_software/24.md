title: "ConfigILM: A Configurable Image-Language Model Library"

description: |
     The library ConfigILM is a state-of-the-art tool for Python developers seeking to rapidly and iteratively develop image and language models within the pytorch framework. This open-source library provides a convenient implementation for seamlessly combining models from two of the most popular pytorch libraries, the highly regarded timm and huggingface. With an extensive collection of nearly 1000 image and over 100 language models, with an additional 120,000 community-uploaded models in the huggingface model collection, ConfigILM offers a diverse range of model combinations that require minimal implementation effort. Its vast array of models makes it an unparalleled resource for developers seeking to create innovative and sophisticated image-language models with ease.
