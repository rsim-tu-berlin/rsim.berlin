title: "Transformer-based Multi-Modal Learning for Multi Label Remote Sensing Image Classification"

description: |
     This repository contains code of our Synchronized Class Token Fusion (SCT Fusion) architecture from the Transformer-based Multi-Modal Learning for Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification paper. The proposed architecture leverages modality-specific attention-based transformer encoders to process varying input modalities, while exchanging information across modalities by synchronizing the special class tokens after each transformer encoder block. The synchronization involves fusing the class tokens with a trainable fusion transformation, resulting in a synchronized class token that contains information from all modalities. As the fusion transformation is trainable, it allows to reach an accurate representation of the shared features among different modalities. The repository contains the code of the architecture as well as the training and inference code on the BigEarthNet dataset.
