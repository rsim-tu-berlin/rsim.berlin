title: "Annotation Cost Efficient Active Learning for Content Based Image Retrieval"

description: |
     This repository contains code for our annotation cost efficient active learning method (ANNEAL) that aims to iteratively enrich the training set by annotating the most informative image pairs as similar or dissimilar, while accurately modelling a deep metric space. This is achieved by two consecutive steps. In the first step the pairwise image similarity is modeled based on the available training set. Then, in the second step the most uncertain and diverse (i.e., informative) image pairs are selected to be annotated. Unlike the existing AL methods for CBIR, at each AL iteration of ANNEAL, a human expert is asked to annotate the most informative image pairs as similar/dissimilar. This significantly reduces the annotation cost compared to annotating images with land-use/land cover class labels. The code is written with Pytorch.
