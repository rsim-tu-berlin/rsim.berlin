title: "Multi-Label Noise Robust Collaborative Learning for Remote Sensing Image Classification"

description: |
     This repository contains the code for our multi-label learning method based on the idea of co-training for scene classification of remote sensing (RS) images with noisy labels. Our proposed multi-label noise robust collaborative learning (RCML) method identifies, ranks, and excludes noisy multi-labels in RS images based on three main modules: 1) the discrepancy module; 2) the group lasso module; and 3) the swap module. The discrepancy module ensures that the two networks learn diverse features, while producing the same predictions. The task of the group lasso module is to detect the potentially noisy labels assigned to multi-labeled training images, while the swap module is devoted to exchange the ranking information between two networks. The code is written in Tensorflow 2.
