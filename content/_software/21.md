title: "Advanced Deep Learning Architectures for Accurate Detection of Subsurface Tile Drainage Pipes from Remote Sensing Images"

description: |
     This repository contains the code used for advanced deep learning architectures for accurate detection of subsurface tile drainage pipes from RS images. It contains two architectures: i) an improved UNet architecture; and ii) TransUNet, an architecture utilizing a transformer as feature encoder. The code is written based on PyTorch or Tensorflow depending on the architecture.
