title: "Plasticity-Stability Preserving Multi-Task Learning for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval"

description: |
     This repository contains the code for our PLASTA-MTL approach devoted to plasticity-stability preserving multi-task learning for image retrieval in remote sensing. PLASTA-MTL includes two novel loss functions: i) the plasticity preserving loss (PPL) function for minimizing the difference of gradient magnitudes for the global representation and task-specific embedding spaces; and ii) the stability preserving loss (SPL) function for minimizing the angular distances between the task gradients over global representation space. For the training of PLASTA-MTL approach, this repository also includes our sequential optimization algorithm.
