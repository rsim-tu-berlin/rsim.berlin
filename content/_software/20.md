title: "SCI-CBIR: Simultaneous Image Compression and Indexing for Scalable Content-Based Retrieval in Remote Sensing"

description: |
     This repository contains the code for our SCI-CBIR approach devoted to simultaneous image compression and indexing for scalable content-based retrieval in remote sensing. SCI-CBIR includes two main steps: i) deep learning-based compression; and ii) deep hashing-based indexing. For the training of SCI-CBIR approach, this repository also includes our multi-stage learning procedure with automatic loss weighting techniques.
