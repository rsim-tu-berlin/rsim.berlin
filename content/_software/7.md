title: "Deep Learning Models for BigEarthNet-S2 with 43 Classes"

description: |
    This repository contains: i) code to use the BigEarthNet-S2 archive with the original CORINE Land Cover (CLC)
    Level-3 class nomenclature for deep learning applications; and ii) model weights for deep learning models
    that have been pre-trained on BigEarthNet-S2 for scene classification. The code to use the pre-trained deep
    learning models, to train new models, and to evaluate pre-trained models is implemented based on both TensorFlow and PyTorch.
