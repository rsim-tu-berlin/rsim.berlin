title: "CHNR: Unsupervised Cross-Modal Hashing Method Robust to the Noisy Image-Text Correspondence"

description: |
     This repository contains the code for our unsupervised cross-modal hashing method robust to the noisy image-text correspondences (CHNR).
     CHNR consists of three mod-ules: 1) feature extraction module, which extracts feature representations of image-text pairs; 2) noise detection module, which detects potential noisy correspondences; and 3) hashing module that generates cross-modal binary hash code.
