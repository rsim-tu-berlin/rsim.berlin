title: "Deep Learning Models for BigEarthNet-S2 with 19 Classes"

description: |
    This repository contains code to use the BigEarthNet Sentinel-2 (denoted as BigEarthNet-S2) archive with
    the nomenclature of 19 classes for deep learning applications. The nomenclature of 19 classes was defined
    by interpreting and arranging the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) Level-3 nomenclature based on the properties of
    Sentinel-2 images. The code to use the pre-trained deep learning models, to train new models, and to
    evaluate pre-trained models is implemented based on TensorFlow.
