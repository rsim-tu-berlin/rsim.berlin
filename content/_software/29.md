title: "Generative Reasoning Integrated Label Noise Robust Deep Image Representation Learning"

description: |
     This repository contains code for our generative reasoning integrated label noise robust deep representation learning (GRID) approach that aims to model the complementary characteristics of discriminative and generative reasoning for image representation learning (IRL) under noisy labels. To this end, GRID integrates generative reasoning into discriminative reasoning through a supervised variational autoencoder. This allows GRID to automatically detect training samples with noisy labels. Then, through our label noise robust hybrid representation learning strategy, GRID adjusts the whole learning procedure for IRL of these samples through generative reasoning and that of other samples through discriminative reasoning. GRID learns discriminative image representations while preventing interference of noisy labels independently from the IRL method being selected. The code is written in TensorFlow.
