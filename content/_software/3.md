title: "Metric-Learning-Based Deep Hashing Network for Content-Based Retrieval of Remote Sensing Images"

description: |
    This repository contains the code of our metric-learning based hashing network, which learns: 1) a semantic-based metric space for effective feature representation; and 2) compact binary hash codes for fast archive search. Our network considers an interplay of multiple loss functions that allows to jointly learn a metric based semantic space facilitating similar images to be clustered together in that target space and at the same time producing compact final activations that lose negligible information when binarized.
