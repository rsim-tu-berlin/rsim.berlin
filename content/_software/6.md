title: "parallelCollGS: Parallel Download from Sentinel Collaborative Ground Segments"

description: |
  This repository provides a python toolchain for parallel queries to download Sentinel 1, 2, and 3 products
  from a varying number of collaborative ground segments. This toolchain
  abstracts <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sentinelsat/" target="_blank">sentinelsat</a> Python API client
  to support parallelized mirror access, and thus provides
  simultaneous access to both high-speed and high-coverage mirrors while reusing the workflow of the
  non-parallelized client. While keeping as much of the original clientâ€™s workflow intact as possible,
  a fault-tolerant mechanism is included in parallelCollGS for accessing multiple mirrors in parallel.
  In addition, parallelCollGS uses a scheduling strategy for concurrent downloads to ensure optimal
  utilization of the available bandwidth. The toolchain provides convenient access to Hadoop
  Distributed File System (HDFS) via the Apache Hadoop stack based interface for the convenient
  upload of obtained products.
