description: |
    This repository contains the code of the paper S2-cGAN: Self-Supervised Adversarial Representation Learning for Binary
    Change Detection in Multispectral Images. The model has been trained and tested on
    <a href="https://github.com/MinZHANG-WHU/FDCNN" target="_blank">Wordview 2 Dataset</a> for Binary Change Detection.
    The model is implemented in PyTorch.
