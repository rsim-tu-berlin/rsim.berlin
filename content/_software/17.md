title:  Deep Metric Learning-Based Semi-Supervised Regression With Alternate Learning

description: |
     This repository contains the code for our deep metric learning-based semi-supervised regression (DML-S2R) method for parameter estimation problems. Our method aims to mitigate the problems of insufficient amount of labeled samples without collecting any additional samples with target values. To this end, DML-S2R is made up of two main steps: i) pairwise similarity modeling with scarce labeled data; and ii) triplet-based metric learning with abundant unlabeled data. The first step estimates the target value differences of labeled samples with a Siamese neural network (SNN) to model pairwise sample similarities. The second step employs the SNN of the first step for triplet-based deep metric learning that exploits not only labeled samples but also unlabeled samples. For the end-to-end training of DML-S2R, an alternate learning strategy is applied for the two steps.
