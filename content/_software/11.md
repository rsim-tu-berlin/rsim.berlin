title: Informative and Representative Triplet Selection for Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Retrieval

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our informative and representative triplet selection method in the context of multi-label remote sensing image retrieval. Our method selects a small set of the most representative and informative triplets based on two main steps. In the first step, a set of anchors that are diverse to each other in the embedding space is selected from the current mini-batch using an iterative algorithm. In the second step, different sets of positive and negative images are chosen for each anchor by evaluating the relevancy, hardness and diversity of the images among each other based on a novel strategy. The selection of the most informative and representative triplets results in: i) reducing the computational complexity of the training phase without any significant loss on the performance; and ii) an increase in learning speed since informative triplets allow fast convergence.
