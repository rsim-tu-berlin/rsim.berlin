title: A Novel Graph-Theoretic Deep Representation Learning Method for Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Retrieval

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our graph-theoretic deep representation learning method in the context of multi-label remote sensing image retrieval. Our method aims to extract and exploit multi-label co-occurrence relationships associated to each remote sensing (RS) image in the archive. To this end, each training image is initially represented with a graph structure that provides region-based image representation combining both local information and the related spatial organization. Unlike the other graph-based methods, the proposed method contains a novel learning strategy to train a deep neural network for automatically predicting a graph structure of each RS image in the archive. This strategy employs a region representation learning loss function to characterize the image content based on its multi-label co-occurrence relationship.
