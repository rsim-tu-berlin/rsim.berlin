title: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Loss Functions for Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification

description: |
    This repository contains the code for our comparative study on deep learning loss functions in the context of
    multi-label remote sensing image classification. In this study, seven different deep learning loss functions
    have been compared in terms of their: 1) overall accuracy; 2) class imbalance awareness (for which the number
    of samples associated to each class significantly varies); 3) convexibility and differentiability; and 4)
    learning efficiency. The code is written based on TensorFlow.
