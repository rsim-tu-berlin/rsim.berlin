title: "HySpecNet-11k: A Large-Scale Hyperspectral Dataset for Benchmarking Learning-Based Hyperspectral Image Compression Methods"

description: |
  This repository contains code of a learning-based hyperspectral image compression framework that includes several benchmark methods and pre-trained weights. It allows an easy way to implement, train and evaluate learning-based hyperspectral image compression methods. The code is written in PyTorch.
