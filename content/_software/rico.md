title: "rico-hdl: A Fast and Easy-To-Use Remote Sensing Image Format Converter for Deep-Learning"

description: |
  rico-hdl is a fast and easy-to-use remote sensing image format converter for
  high-throughput deep-learning (rico-hdl).
  The tool converts the remote sensing images into a DL-optimized format.
  The resulting output will provide significantly higher throughput than the
  original remote sensing images (patches) and should be used instead of the unprocessed dataset.
  The data is encoded in a DL-framework independent format, ensuring flexible use.
