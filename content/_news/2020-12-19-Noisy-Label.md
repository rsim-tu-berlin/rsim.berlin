    To reduce the negative impact of noisy land-use and land-cover annotations, we research on developing
    noise robust deep learning models. We have recently made public our codes on noise robust deep learning
    models for Earth observation at <a href="https://noisy-labels-in-rs.org" target="_blank">noisy-labels-in-rs.org</a>.
