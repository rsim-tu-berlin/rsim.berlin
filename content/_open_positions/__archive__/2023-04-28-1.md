description: |
    Based on the overarching research foci of BIFOLD, the Graduate School offers PhD projects in the areas of current challenges in Al, Data Science (DS) and distributed analysis of large amounts of data, with focus on DM, ML, and their intersection; including the development of novel theories, algorithms, and technologies, as well as prototypical systems and tools. The topics within foundational research in DM and scalable data processing range from distributed DM to secure big data processing, knowledge and research data management, semantic technologies, data programming languages and their compilation, in particular automatic parallelization, distribution, and hardware adaptation as well as the processing of data in the Internet of Things. In this context, the focus lies in the development of novel systems and technologies. Topics within foundational research in ML include Bayesian inference, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and secure ML. Representative topics within the intersection of DM and ML include information integration, information visualization, and data cleansing, in terms of both individual steps and the holistic examination of (data) modelling in iterative and exploratory processes of Al applications in the sciences, medicine and humanities. Another relevant area is that of responsible Al, which aims to provide methods and technologies for Al applications to become understandable, reproducible, and compliant with ethical and legal frameworks.
