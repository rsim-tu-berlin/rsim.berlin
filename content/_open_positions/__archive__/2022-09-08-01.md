description: |
    The Remote Sensing Image Analysis (RSiM) Group is looking for a highly motivated Research Associate who is interested in performing cutting-edge research on machine learning models applied to organic agriculture monitoring. Starting from the analysis of the start-of-the-art models, the successful candidate will focus on the design and development of novel semantic segmentation models that tackle research problems related to domain adaptation and generalization, self-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning, multimodal learning, learning with imbalanced/few data or with noisy labeled data, spatiotemporal fusion. The methodologies being developed will be applied to the images acquired by satellite systems. The research conducted by the selected candidate will advance the capabilities of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models towards accurate organic agriculture monitoring.
    The candidate is also expected to publish and present the achieved research results. This research activity is a part of the project ‘Earth Observation and Artificial Intelligence for monitoring organic agriculture’ funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.
