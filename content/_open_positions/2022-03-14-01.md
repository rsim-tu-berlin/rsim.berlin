description: |
    The Remote Sensing Image Analysis Group is seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a strong record of accomplishment in machine learning and computer vision. Successful candidate will conduct research and develop advanced deep learning based algorithms for satellite image search/retrieval from large-scale data archives and semantic scene understanding. This will entail the development of novel deep learning models that can address the problems on incomplete, noisy and imbalanced training sets for scalable image search, retrieval and classification.
    This research activity is a part of the ERC-funded project:
    BigEarth â€“ Accurate and Scalable Processing of Big Data in Earth Observation
    <br/>
